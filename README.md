# ElectricFieldVisualizer
This project is meant to display what forces in an electric field look like around multiple charges

# Directions
* The arrows point in the direction of the force, and the opacity of the arrows displays the strength of the force.
* Use the scroll wheel to control size of charges
* Use the 'N' key to place a negetive charge
* Use the 'P' key to place a positive charge
* Press the mouse to drop a positive test charge
* Use the 'R' key to reset everything

# What I learned
* How to apply knowledge of physics to computer science
